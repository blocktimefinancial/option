## Sample Files

The files in this directory are our scratch pad.  They may or may not work, compile, yada, yada, use at
your own risk.  Because Soroban is Alpha, these examples, snippets may only work for a short period of time.

This directory will be discarded upon the final commit.  If we find any of the snippets of use, we'll create
a new repo for them.
